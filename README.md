# Project-Landing-Page
Odin Project assignment

This is the main project for the flexbox section in the foundations Odin Project course. It involved referencing a screenshot of a completed website template and attempting to re-create it using html and css, while using flexbox for the alignment of the different sections.
Overall very happy with my finished result, only thing I think I could majorly imporove upon is my use of classes. It would be better to use some classes for multiple parts of the site, I tended to use classes almost like unique ID's during this.
